      LeBron took the league by storm in his rookie year, averaging 20.9 points
      per game. He also won the Rookie of the Year award for his performance
      that season. During this tenure, he led the Cavaliers to an Eastern
      Conference Championship in the 2006-2007 season. He also won the NBA
      Scoring Title in the 2007-2008 season. He won the NBA MVP award in
      back-to-back seasons during his first stint with the Cavs as well.

      LeBronâ€™s time with the Heat was arguably his most accomplished part of his

      Champion.

      third Finals MVP.

      during the pandemic-ridden 2020 season. He is currently still a member of
      the Lakers.
