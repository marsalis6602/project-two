    LeBron took the league by storm in his rookie year, averaging 20.9 points
    per game. He also won the Rookie of the Year award for his performance that
    season. During this tenure, he led the Cavaliers to an Eastern Conference
    Championship in the 2006-2007 season. He also won the NBA Scoring Title in
    the 2007-2008 season. He won the NBA MVP award in back-to-back seasons
    during his first stint with the Cavs as well.

    Champion.

    Finals MVP.
